# EBOP Model Automatic input Value Estimation Neural network
A machine learning model for estimating input values for characterization of detached eclipsing
binaries stars by [JKTEBOP](https://www.astro.keele.ac.uk/jkt/codes/jktebop.html).

Included in this repository are codes for generating training & test datasets, for building,
training & testing the machine learning model and _some other stuff still to be decided_.

> [!WARNING]  
> This is a work in progress. Handle with care.

Detailed instructions on setting up the runtime environment, training & testing datasets,
and training a model can be found [here in the wiki](https://github.com/SteveOv/ebop_maven/wiki/setup-instructions)
